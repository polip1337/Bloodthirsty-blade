They aren’t named for the color of their granite spine but for the sheer number of orcs and goblins that dwell within them. Too wild to be tamed by civilization, the region is swarming with greenskins and worse. Here, there are griffons and dragons, but none of that scares you. You were made for dragon slaying."
