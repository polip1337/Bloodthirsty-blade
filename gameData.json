It is only after hours and days of battle, when you have drunk the blood of monsters and men that you can finally start to think straight.",

Your wielder doesn’t understand what’s going on any more than you do, but they are not hard to convince. Power appeals to everyone.",

They aren’t named for the color of their granite spine but for the sheer number of orcs and goblins that dwell within them. Too wild to be tamed by civilization, the region is swarming with greenskins and worse. Here, there are griffons and dragons, but none of that scares you. You were made for dragon slaying."
